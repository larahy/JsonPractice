{"storyOutputs":{"text":"Once upon a zibbity-zop on a sunny day at the playground, Brenda found a banana. But this wasn't just any banana, oh no! It was a super-duper giggle-wiggle banana that made funny sounds when you squeezed it. Brenda picked up the banana and gave it a squeeze. Squeak! Blip-blop! The banana started to sing a silly song: 'Brenda loves bananas, bananas love Brenda, together they'll have a whole lot of fun-dra!' Brenda couldn't help but giggle and snort, which made the banana go 'Boop-a-doop!' The other kids at the playground gathered around to see what the fuss was all about. Brenda and the banana put on a show of wacky dances and goofy faces. They hopped, skipped, and boinged all over the playground, spreading laughter like jelly on toast. Brenda and the banana became the stars of the playground that day, with everyone joining in on the banana bonanza fun. And so, with a zap-zoom and a flip-flap, Brenda and her banana friend brought joy and laughter to all, proving that sometimes the silliest things can bring the biggest smiles.","title":"Brenda and the Banana Bonanza","cost":0.000378,"generationTime":""},"storyInputs":{"age":"6","type":"Makes you laugh","subtype":"A story full of silly sounds, made up wordsâ€¦ like The Book with No Pictures.","characters":["Brenda"],"objects":"banana","location":"a playground"},"illustrationInputs":{"style":""},"model":{"name":"gpt-3.5-turbo","temperature":1,"maxTokens":500,"top_p":1,"frequencyPenalty":0,"presencePenalty":0},"createdAt":"2024-04-15T19:27:45.996Z","id":""}
